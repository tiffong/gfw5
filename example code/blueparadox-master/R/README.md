# *R* replication code for "The blue paradox: Preemptive overfishing in marine reserves"

This sub-directory contains the *R* code used in McDermott, Meng, *et al*. (2018). It contains a single script file, `R/blueparadox.R`, which can be used to reproduce Figs. 1-2, 4-5, and S5-S6 from the paper. In addition, while Fig. 3 was originally produced using STATA (see the accompanying sub-directory), the script contains code for producing a mock-up version in *R*.

This *R* code was jointly written by Grant McDermott (grantmcd@uoregon.edu) and Gavin McDonald (gmcdonald@bren.ucsb.edu).

## Requirements

*R* is free, open-source and available for download [here](https://www.r-project.org/). We highly recommend running *R* in the RStudio IDE, which you can also download for free [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You will need to install a number of external *R* packages to run the code successfully. These are listed at the top of the `R/blueparadox.R` file. An easy way to ensure that you have the correct versions of all the packages is to run the following code chunk in your *R* console:

```
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_install(c(tidyverse, broom, lubridate, sf, sp, raster, maps, rworldmap, rms, estimatr, furrr, scales, cowplot, extrafont, here))
devtools::install_github("oswaldosantos/ggsn") ## Using development version of ggsn
pacman::p_update()
```

The `extrafont` package is used to embed the [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font (which must be installed separately on your system) in some of the figures. Please note that this requires some minor setup upon first use. See [here](https://github.com/wch/extrafont/blob/master/README.md) for instructions. However, you can also skip this setup if you want; in which case the code will automatically use one of *R*'s default fonts instead.
